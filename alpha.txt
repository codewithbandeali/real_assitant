## Ready to Sell Your Property?

If you are prepared to sell your property through Carratelli Real Estate, please proceed with offering your property.
# Do You Want to Buy a Property?

Proposing or searching for the property that fulfills your desires is an honor for us. To do this, we often need a cognitive contact aimed at understanding your real needs. Once we determine the characteristics you are looking for, we present you with several real estate proposals that you can conveniently view from home on your PC, and we will happily schedule onsite visits.

If we do not have the "right" property—that is, one that fully reflects your needs—thanks to our vast network of partners, one of our collaborators will carry out a targeted search. This process continues until we find the right real estate solution. You will always be assisted by the collaborator who best knows the area of your interest and the type of property you are looking for.

Our longestablished trust and continuous relationships with many of our clients, both buyers and sellers, often allow us to know about properties that are not officially on the market. For this reason, our "real estate portfolio" sometimes includes properties that require a request for access to confidential information, or even the total absence of any public details. We recommend that you contact us directly so that we can truly offer you that unique home that meets your desires.



## Before Purchase

 **Technical & Documentation Checks:**  
  The Carratelli RE partner technical studio verifies all technical/cadastral documentation in advance and can evaluate the feasibility of new interventions. This ensures that any potential issues are identified before listing your property.

 **Architecture & Design Support:**  
  Together with the Carratelli RE Architecture Studio, we illustrate any existing projects or develop new ones with detailed renderings of both the internal and external spaces. This helps you understand the potential of the property you are interested in.

 **Mortgage Loan Assistance:**  
  Thanks to our established relationships with various banking institutions, we assist our customers in all phases relating to obtaining a mortgage or financing.



## During the Purchase

Once the desired property has been found, the process is as follows:

 A purchase proposal is signed.
 A form is filed with the Chamber of Commerce.
 Upon acceptance, commission dues mature, which amount to 4% plus VAT as per law:
   **Payment Schedule:**  
     10% upon acceptance  
     50% upon signing the preliminary contract  
     The balance on the date of the final deed



## After Purchase

Following the acquisition, the same process applies for the commission payments:

 A purchase proposal is signed.
 A form is filed with the Chamber of Commerce.

# Swap  Sell and Buy at the Same Time

With this new service, Carratelli RE addresses customers with a dual need: to purchase a property while simultaneously selling another.



## How It Works

 **Dual Transaction:**  
  Whether the property is located in Italy or abroad, and regardless of whether it is a main residence or a holiday home, through our Exchange service, we can propose or find a new property that meets your specified characteristics while coordinating the sale of your current property.

 **Dynamic Coordination:**  
  Our primary goal is to ensure a seamless process by coordinating both the sale and the purchase simultaneously. You can autonomously check on our website which properties owners are interested in exchanging, or you can fill out the form below. An expert will then activate a targeted search to satisfy your specific needs.

 **Property Advertising:**  
  Your property will be advertised to attract customers interested in selling with the aim of buying another property with particular characteristics.

 **Cost Savings:**  
  Taxation is applied only on the property with the highest value, and brokerage commissions are charged only on that property as well, resulting in significant economic savings.

 **Example Scenario:**  
  If you own an unused property in the city and wish to buy a wonderful villa by the sea, Carratelli RE can manage this dual need and help you achieve the best possible outcome.




## Our Service

For clients interested in Property Finding, our expert agent will collect every detailed request to capture all your real estate desires. If you need to buy a property with welldefined characteristics and are tired of proposals that don't meet your requirements, a dedicated Property Finder is the ideal solution.



## How We Operate

 **Initial Meeting:**  
  Meetings take place in our offices or at your residence. We begin by understanding your needs so that your project becomes our project.

 **Property Profile Creation:**  
  Together, we create a detailed profile of your desired property, considering aspects such as typology, location, context, nearby services, and specific features. We also set a clear timeframe and budget.

 **Financial and Fiscal Analysis:**  
  Our team of specialized professionals analyzes the fiscal and economic aspects to ensure a sound investment.

 **Research Phase:**  
  The search typically lasts 30 to 90 days, though we can work on shorter timelines for specific needs.  
   Within the first 30 days, we present several proposals that match your criteria.  
   If needed, the subsequent 30 to 60 days are dedicated to further research.

 **Ongoing Communication:**  
  While we search for your property, you continue with your priorities, and your Property Finder will constantly update you on the progress.

 **Inspection and Due Diligence:**  
  Once a suitable property is identified, we arrange an inspection and perform urban planning, cadastral, and fiscal due diligence to prepare for a proper commercial negotiation and purchase.

The transparency and linearity of each step are the hallmarks of our success.

Covering a gross area of about 3,084 sqm and set on 8.5 hectares of land, the property currently operates as a hospitality business and represents a unique blend of ancient history and modern restoration.



## Historical Background

 **Origins:**  
  Originally built in 593 AD as part of the Byzantine corridor, the castle later became a monastery around the year 1000. In 1474 it was ceded to a family of counts, serving as a summer residence for over 500 years.
 **Heritage:**  
  Over time, the property has maintained its noble lineage (with family names changing only through female inheritance) and now consists of 27 residential units – 11 apartments and 16 suites – all meticulously restored with chestnut wood beams and antique terracotta floors. The restoration, assisted by the Ministry of Culture, has made 23 of these units particularly notable for public interest and fiscal benefits.



## Description

   The units range from 59 to 186 sqm and offer between 1 and 3 bedrooms (96% with ensuite bathrooms).

   Notable examples include a unit in the "Torre Piccola" (186 sqm with a large living room, 2 double bedrooms, and double bathrooms) and a 170 sqm unit on the first floor with a spacious living room and seating for 7.
 **Artistic Details:**  
   The castle’s historical significance is underlined by its connection to ancient Roman and papal history (including refuge by a saint in 174 AD and residence by Pope Niccolò V in 1450).  
   The chapel of St. Paul houses a beautiful baldachin for papal visits, and exquisite frescoes dating from 1315–1319 by Meo da Siena (a pupil of Giotto) embellish some rooms.

 **Wellness and Amenities:**  
   A dedicated spa area includes a sauna, Turkish bath, emotional shower, and a heated hydromassage pool.
   A restaurant hall with a coffered ceiling, a 129 sqm pergola with panoramic views of Perugia, operable glass windows, and a wellequipped kitchen add to the estate’s luxury.

# Agriturismo vs. Bed & Breakfast: What Are the Differences?

**Published by:** Carratelli  
**Date:** 2 years ago



## Overview

Both agriturismo and bed & breakfast (B&B) represent popular forms of hospitality in Italy, yet they cater to different business models and lifestyles. Understanding their distinct characteristics can help you choose the solution that best fits your needs—whether you aim to generate income from a part of your home or launch a fullscale agritourism venture.



## Key Differences

### Agriturismo

 **Core Activities:**  
   Combines agricultural or livestock farming with hospitality services.
   Focuses on land protection, local crop cultivation, and the promotion of rural traditions.
 **Business Model:**  
   Involves operating a restaurant or offering onsite accommodation (or both) alongside farming activities.
   Subject to specific regional regulations that govern agricultural and tourism activities.
 **Investment Potential:**  
   Provides opportunities to generate income from both agricultural production (e.g., wine, olive oil) and hospitality.
   Often seen as a comprehensive business venture that can enhance the value of rural properties.

### Bed & Breakfast

 **Core Service:**  
   Primarily offers overnight accommodation with breakfast.
   Typically operates within a private residence, making use of spare rooms.
 **Business Model:**  
   Simpler to manage compared to agriturismo; generally involves fewer operational complexities.
   Often familymanaged and can be run on a parttime basis.
 **Flexibility:**  
   Suitable for those who wish to generate extra income without committing to the broader scope of a full agritourism business.
   In Italy, the traditional B&B model can also be expanded to an entrepreneurial level (with the necessary VAT registration and administrative steps).



## Choosing the Best Option

 **Assess Your Property:**  
   If you own a large property with significant agricultural potential, agriturismo might be the ideal way to capitalize on both farming and hospitality.
   If you have a residence with spare rooms in a touristfriendly area, a B&B might be a more straightforward option.
 **Consider Your Investment Goals:**  
   Agriturismo offers a diversified revenue stream through the sale of farm products and tourism services.
   A B&B is typically less capitalintensive and easier to start, especially if you wish to keep your business operations occasional or familyrun.
 **Regulatory Requirements:**  
   Agriturismo activities are subject to regional agricultural and tourism regulations.
   B&B operations are defined by specific Italian laws (e.g., DPR 445/2000, Law 241/1990) and generally require fewer regulatory hurdles.



## How Carratelli RE Can Help

Carratelli RE offers comprehensive property management and real estate advisory services, including:
 **Expert Consultation:**  
   Indepth interviews to determine which hospitality model suits your property and investment goals.
 **Market Insights:**

*# Farmhouse for Sale: Characteristics and Parameters to Respect

**Published by:** Carratelli  
**Date:** 2 years ago



## Overview

When considering the sale or purchase of an agriturismo (farmhouse) in Tuscany, it's essential to understand the specific characteristics that define a true agriturismo. This is more than just a rural home with guest rooms—it’s a multifaceted business that combines agriculture with hospitality, while preserving and enhancing local traditions and resources.



## Key Parameters of Agriturismo

To qualify as an agriturismo, three fundamental conditions must be met:

1. **Agricultural Production or Animal Breeding**  
    The property must be actively involved in cultivation, forestry, or livestock farming.
    Products generated (such as wine, olive oil, and local produce) can be sold on the market or used as Km0 ingredients in the onsite restaurant and farm shop.

2. **Enhancement of Local Resources**  
    The business must promote and protect the agricultural and cultural heritage of the territory.
    Emphasis is placed on using local crops and traditional techniques to valorize regional traditions.

3. **Hospitality Services**  
    An agriturismo combines the agricultural activity with hospitality services—either through catering (often featuring local products) or by offering overnight accommodations (or both).
    This may include additional experiential activities such as educational tours, craft workshops, and outdoor sports to enrich the guest experience.

*A fourth “commercial” element often enhances the offering by integrating unique, experiential proposals to increase the overall appeal and profitability of the business.*



## Regional Regulations and Standards

 **Activity Criteria & Limitations:**  
  Regional laws set out the precise requirements for what constitutes an agriturismo, including the scale of agricultural activity and the nature of hospitality services offered.

 **Qualification and Tax Regulations:**  
  Specific tax incentives and classifications are available for agriturismi, making it important to verify that all legal and fiscal criteria are met.

 **Health and Hygiene Standards:**  
  Compliance with health regulations is mandatory, especially for any food and accommodation services.

 **Communication of Rates and Operating Periods:**  
  Transparency regarding pricing, service schedules, and seasonal availability is required by law.



## Practical Considerations When Buying or Selling

 **Valuation:**  
   Knowing the true value of an agriturismo is crucial. Engage with professionals who understand the local market and can accurately assess both the property and its incomegenerating potential.
  
 **Conversion Potential:**  
   For those looking to buy a property to convert it into an agriturismo, ensure that the structure meets the required parameters (i.e., agricultural activity, land preservation, and hospitality facilities).

 **Professional Guidance:**  
   Rely on specialized real estate agencies, such as Carratelli RE, to navigate the complex regulations and market dynamics of agriturismo properties in Tuscany.



## How Carratelli RE Can Help

 **Market Expertise:**  
  Carratelli RE leverages local market data and industry knowledge to identify properties that meet the strict criteria for agriturismo.

**Published by:** Carratelli  
**Date:** 2 years ago



## Overview

Condominium regulations are essential documents that govern the use and maintenance of common areas and services within a condominium. They help prevent disputes among owners and ensure that shared property is managed fairly and efficiently.



## Key Points

### Purpose of Condominium Regulations
 **Prevent Disputes:**  
  Clear, written rules help avoid conflicts among owners.
 **Define Common Use:**  
  Regulations cover the use of common areas and services, excluding individual units which remain private property.
 **Legal Basis:**  
  Established by the Civil Code, these regulations integrate and supplement mandatory legal provisions regarding administration, owner rights, and expense distribution.



### When Are They Required?
 A condominium must have a regulation if there are more than 10 owners.
 The document must be approved by the condominium assembly by majority vote.



### Types of Condominium Regulations

1. **Contractual Regulation:**  
    Prepared by the builder and accepted by buyers at the time of purchase.
    Can be updated with unanimous consent of all condominium owners.

2. **Assembly (Majority) Regulation:**  
    Approved during the condominium meeting if at least 50% of owners participate and the vote represents more than 500 thousandths of the total shares.
    Limits: Cannot affect individual ownership rights or common parts beyond managing the use of shared spaces and expense distribution.

3. **Judicial Regulation:**  
    Mandated by a judge when the assembly fails to adopt a regulation.
    Ensures that the condominium has a valid set of rules for common use.



### What the Regulation Must Include

 **Identification Data:**  
   Name and address of the building.
   Cadastral data.

 **Internal Descriptions:**  
   Number of floors, housing units, and auxiliary spaces (e.g., cellars, technical rooms).

 **External Descriptions:**  
   Details of common areas such as access paths, courtyards, gardens, etc.

 **Obligations and Prohibitions:**  
   Rights and duties of the owners regarding the maintenance and use of common areas.
   Specific prohibitions (e.g., restrictions on modifications in common spaces).

 **Expense Distribution:**  
   Methodology for dividing costs among condominium owners.



## Conclusion

Condominium regulations are a vital tool to protect the common good of all owners. They ensure smooth management of shared spaces and prevent conflicts by setting clear rules based on the Civil Code.

*# Living in a Condominium: The Advantages

**Published by:** Carratelli  
**Date:** 2 years ago



## Overview

Choosing between a detached house and a condominium can be challenging. While many dream of the privacy and space a detached home offers, living in a condominium provides numerous economic and lifestyle benefits. This article explores the advantages of condominium living and offers guidance on choosing the right environment for a harmonious, costeffective lifestyle.



## Key Advantages of Condominium Living

### Cost Sharing
 **Maintenance Expenses:**  
   In a condominium, the costs for ordinary maintenance and extraordinary repairs of common areas (such as staircases, elevators, exterior lighting, roofs, and facades) are distributed among all owners.
 **Service Management:**  
   Costs for shared services like concierge, cleaning, security (e.g., electric gates), and recreational amenities (e.g., swimming pools, tennis courts, party rooms) are also divided, reducing individual financial burdens.

### Access to Essential Services
 **Neighborhood Amenities:**  
   Condominiums are often located in areas with a high concentration of essential services—schools, clinics, shops, and even shopping centers—which can make daily life more convenient.
 **Community Benefits:**  
   Proximity to neighbors creates a supportive social network, which is especially valuable for those living alone or far from family.

### Ease of Management
 **Simpler Maintenance:**  
   Unlike detached homes, where you are solely responsible for every aspect of maintenance, condominium owners benefit from shared management responsibilities.
 **Professional Management:**  
   Many condominiums are managed by professional property management companies, ensuring that communal areas are well maintained and disputes are minimized.

### Social and Lifestyle Advantages
 **Community Living:**  
   Sharing common spaces can foster a sense of community, providing opportunities for social interaction and a safer living environment.
 **Security and Stability:**  
   The presence of a structured management system and a cooperative community environment often translates into higher security and stability.



## Considerations When Buying in a Condominium

 **Financial Transparency:**  
   Verify there are no defaulters and check the amount of the condominium fee along with any additional charges (such as supercondominium fees).
 **Neighborly Compatibility:**  
   Consider the composition of your future neighbors to ensure a harmonious living environment.
 **Maintenance History:**  
   Look into how regularly common areas are maintained and managed, as this can impact your quality of life and the value of your investment.



## Conclusion

While the allure of a detached house lies in privacy and exclusive use of space, condominium living offers substantial advantages—cost savings, access to amenities, easier management, and a builtin community. For those seeking a balanced, secure, and convenient lifestyle, buying an apartment in a wellmanaged condominium can be an excellent choice.

# Ecobonus Second Home in Condominium

**Published by:** Carratelli  
**Date:** 2 years ago



## Overview

The Ecobonus for second homes in condominiums is a powerful incentive designed to improve energy efficiency, thermal insulation, and seismic performance. Originating from the Relaunch Decree 34/2020 (Art. 119), this incentive—often referred to as the 110% Superbonus—provides tax deductions (or cash discounts/credit transfers) for qualifying renovation works on properties, including those used as second homes within condominiums.



## Key Features

### Core Interventions ("Driving" Interventions)
To access the Superbonus, at least one of the following must be carried out:
 **Thermal Insulation:**  
   Insulation of horizontal, vertical, and inclined surfaces covering at least 25% of the gross dispersing surface.
 **Heating System Replacement:**  
   Upgrading existing systems to highefficiency options (e.g., condensing boilers, heat pumps, geothermal systems, solar collectors).
 **Seismic Improvements:**  
   Interventions to enhance seismic resistance (applicable to buildings in seismic zones 1 to 3).

### Additional Eligible Works
Once one of the driving interventions is completed, you can also add:
 Replacement of windows (including frames)
 Installation of sunscreens
 Photovoltaic systems
 Removal of architectural barriers
 Solar panels for hot water
 Heat pump water heaters
 Electric car charging stations
 Home automation systems for managing air conditioning and domestic hot water

*All these works must lead to an improvement of at least two energy classes on the APE certificate.*



## Applicability to Condominiums

 **General Eligibility:**  
   All condominiums, even those with more than two residential units, can benefit—provided they do not fall under the luxury categories A1, A8, or A9 (luxury homes, villas, historic homes, and castles).
 **Approval Process:**  
   A condominium assembly meeting must be held. At least onethird of the building’s value in condominium shares must be present to vote, and a majority of those present must approve the bonus strategy.
 **Modes of Benefit:**  
   Options include a discount on the invoice, transfer of the credit (with the help of a bank), or obtaining a tax deduction.



## Updated Benefit Percentages

Under the latest regulations introduced by the Aid Decree Quater:
 **2023:** The Superbonus percentage will drop to 90%.
 **2024:** It will further decrease to 70%.
 **2025:** It will be set at 65%.

*Note: Properties that began the process (with the submission of the CILA) before November 25, 2023, will continue to enjoy the 110% discount until December 31, 2023.*



## Conclusion

The Ecobonus for second homes in condominiums remains an attractive incentive for improving energy efficiency and enhancing property value. Whether you are looking to sell, buy, or convert a property into an agritourism venture, understanding these parameters is crucial.

# Condominium Expenses: What They Are and Who Pays

**Published by:** Carratelli  
**Date:** 2 years ago



## Overview

Condominium expenses cover the costs of managing and maintaining the shared areas and services of a condominium. These fees are an important aspect of condominium living and are divided into two main categories: ordinary and extraordinary expenses.



## Types of Condominium Expenses

### Ordinary Expenses
 **Definition:**  
  Regular, predictable costs necessary for the upkeep and normal functioning of common areas.
 **Examples:**  
   Cleaning of stairs and common spaces  
   Maintenance of electrical systems and lighting (both internal and external)  
   Elevator maintenance, boiler servicing (if centralized), and upkeep of electric gates  
   Condominium taxes, insurance, stationery, and compensation for the administrator or doorman  
 **Payment:**  
  Ordinary expenses are shared by all condominium owners based on the proportion of their ownership (thousandths).

### Extraordinary Expenses
 **Definition:**  
  Unforeseen or nonrecurring costs for major repairs or improvements.
 **Examples:**  
   Structural repairs (e.g., loadbearing walls, roof leaks)  
   Significant renovations or upgrades not required for everyday maintenance
 **Payment:**  
  These expenses are also shared among owners according to the established tables but typically require a higher majority vote in the assembly.



## Payment Responsibilities in Rental Situations

 **Tenant's Responsibilities:**  
   Tenants pay for all ordinary expenses, as they benefit directly from the regular maintenance and services.
 **Owner's Responsibilities:**  
   Owners are responsible for extraordinary expenses, condominium insurance, and the administrator's fee.
 **Consequences of NonPayment:**  
   In case a tenant fails to pay ordinary expenses for more than two months, the tenant may face termination of the rental contract.



## Important Considerations

 **Transfer of Fees:**  
   When buying a new apartment in a condominium, the new owner becomes responsible for paying condominium fees from the date of the sale.
 **Assembly Approval:**  
   Condominium expenses are decided upon during the assembly and require a majority vote to be approved.
 **Maintenance of Common Areas:**  
   Regular upkeep of shared spaces is essential for preserving property value and ensuring a harmonious living environment.



## Conclusion

Understanding condominium expenses is crucial for both property owners and tenants. Knowing the difference between ordinary and extraordinary costs—and who is responsible for each—can help avoid disputes and ensure that all parties are clear about their financial obligations.

**Date:** 2 years ago



## Overview

A condominium administrator is the executive figure responsible for managing the common areas and services of a condominium, as mandated by Italian law (Civil Code, Art. 117). Appointed by the condominium assembly, the administrator ensures the efficient upkeep of the property and enforces the condominium regulations.

   Must not be interdicted or incapacitated.
   Must not be listed among those with protested bills of exchange.
   Must have obtained at least a secondary school diploma.
   Must have completed a specific training course and participate in periodic training sessions.

 **Exemption for Condominium Owners:**  
   If the administrator is also a condominium owner, the diploma and training course requirements may be waived.

 **Professional Insurance:**  
   Given the sensitivity of the role, it is recommended to have professional liability insurance.

 **Term of Appointment:**  
   The appointment lasts for one year and can be renewed annually unless revoked.



## Duties and Responsibilities

The condominium administrator's duties include, but are not limited to:

   Prepare and manage the condominium's budget and maintain a dedicated current account for collecting fees and paying expenses.
   Convene the condominium assembly within 180 days after the end of the management year.
   Ensure timely payment of condominium expenses and pursue action against defaulters when necessary.
  
 **Record Keeping:**  
   Maintain all condominium registers, including meeting minutes, administrator appointments and dismissals, and accounting records.
  
 **General Oversight:**  
   Ensure that the condominium regulations are respected and take action to resolve disputes as mandated by the assembly.



## Conclusion
